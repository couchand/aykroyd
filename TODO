random (some maybe already done?)
---------------------------------

- readme
- derive error reporting
- logging
- more verification on prepare
- txn builder?
- generic client?
- maybe opt in to column order fromrow for structs with named fields
- gate all doctests using derive on derive feature



design directions
-----------------

- fromcolumnsindexed/fromcolumnsnamed
- sqltext/staticsqltext
- multi-backend support????
- named params e.g. where id = @id


potential breaking changes
--------------------------

- derive attribute query => aykroyd ??
- multi-backend probably needs something here?
